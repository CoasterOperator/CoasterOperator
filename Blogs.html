                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>Coaster Studios, wasn't always Coaster Studios. It wasn't automatically famous. We had to build it from the ground up. We hired many developers at the beginning which name was also "Coaster Operator" Coaster Operator is the same game as the game that's currently in the group for "Coaster Studios" It all started with a simple conversation between 2 people named Akramer2k, and Don. Ak had the idea, and since Don was one of his trusteed friends and a great developer he decided to share his idea, and Don had agreed.</p>
                    <p class="extra-content">We had hired many people including a Marketing Manager, and a couple of other positions. Later on, we started getting members to join our group and we slowly advanced into the rankings towards our first 100 members in the group, and discord. Sadly, it was a tuff time around this since we had recently released our game after not updating it for a while staff members started to get concerened. Eventually, we had hit our first strike and 2 of some of our best developers had decided to leave because of the inactivity. Eventually, after this happened we decided to arrange a meeting with our staff members to try and resolve this situation. The meeting was made up of our current staff members which at the moment was around 6. We had brainstormed that we needed advertisements, and new developers to continue work. Especially scripters. We had then made more sneak peeks to keep people interested into the server with Journey to Atlantis, or Cobras Curse. Which had helped us incredibly. Eventually, we hired a couple of more people which helped us become more successful including new marketing managers, head operators as well. Most of these staff members are still here to this day. Eventually, after hiring most of these staff members we noticed significant growth within our community reaching up to around 500 members in discord and our first 1k in our roblox group, which was quite amazing as we celebrated with a give away! Eventually, Ak had decided to make an application to try to make a RAAPA event. RAAPA is a Roblox Association Group that is similar to a convention center where you can showcase your game with visitors or seasoned developers. We had set up our booth and had got accepted to RAAPA. Sadly, we didn't win any votes and gained 2nd place in our award category. But, we gained significant members and are looking forward to continue in the Summer RAAPA event! We released a new ride, called "Giant Drop" Most people know this ride, and it took about a week to make including the building. It was hard work and dedication to get it released that quick which had suprised most people. Coaster Studios still has a bunch of more rides in the making and is looking to release more this month. As of now, Coaster Studios is thriving with members reaching a whopping 9K members in roblox and 2k members in there discord with 2M+ visits in Roblox!</p>

                    <h3>Coaster Studio: A New Era of Thrills</h3>
                    <p>Exciting news for all Coaster Operator fans! Recently, we've embarked on a significant rebranding journey, transforming from Coaster Operator to Coaster Studio. This change marks the beginning of a new era filled with thrilling possibilities and opportunities</p>
                    <p class="extra-content">Since the start of development, our primary focus has been on Coaster Operator. But now, with the new name, we’re ready to expand our horizons. The success of The Giant Drop, which has garnered an impressive 2 million visits on Roblox, is just the beginning of what’s to come. Our amazing community is always hyping up new rides and eagerly anticipating sneak peeks of upcoming attractions. The Sneak Peaks channel on our Discord is the best place to find out about new rides releasing in the near future, including the highly anticipated Darkoaster, one of the many new rides in development. With the rebrand, Coaster Studio is no longer limited to just one game. We are developing various new coaster-themed games, each promising unique and exhilarating adventures. Within Coaster Operator, you can already enjoy operating attractions like Cobra's Curse and Giant Drop. And for those waiting patiently, Fisherboote is still under maintenance, but we promise it will be worth the wait. Our rebrand to Coaster Studio has unlocked many new opportunities, allowing us to bring even more exciting games and experiences to our players. We are thrilled for the future ahead and can't wait to share all the new developments with you. Thank you for being a part of this journey with Coaster Studio. Stay tuned for more updates and thrilling adventures!</p>
